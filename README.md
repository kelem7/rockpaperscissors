## The Odin Project - Web Development 101 
### Project: ROCK PAPER SCISSORS
A fun project using Javascript to create a rock, paper, scissors game against the computer. This game originally functioned throught the Console, and has been updated with a front-end. 

This project is from The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).

See a **live preview** of the page [here](https://kelem7.github.io/rockpaperscissors/).


## Summary 

### Version 1

* Used Math.floor() and Math.random() to create a function that randomly returns 'rock,' 'paper,' or 'scissors' strings. 
* Improved my ability to debug and troubleshoot using Developer Tools, such as utliizng **breakpoints**.
* Used a **for loop** to create five rounds of the game.
* Used **AND and OR operators** to compare scores. 
* Stored user and computer scores in a variable to declare the winner of the five rounds. 
* Used **template literals** to create a final tally of points. 

### Version 2
* Used Javascript to manipulate HTML with methods such as **document.querySelectorAll**, changing text content based on the results of the game, and using **classList** to add classes to items.  
* Improved my comprehension of **click events with eventListeners** and **callback functions**.
* Created a function to disable the click event and clear scores in the HTML document for a new round.
