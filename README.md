### Project: ROCK PAPER SCISSORS
A fun project using Javascript to create a rock, paper, scissors game against the computer. This game currently functions throught the Console. 

This project is from The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).

See a **live preview** of the page [here](#).


## Summary 
* Used Math.floor() and Math.random() to create a function that randomly returns 'rock,' 'paper,' or 'scissors' strings. 
* Improved my ability to debug and troubleshoot using Developer Tools, such as utliizng **breakpoints**.
* Used a **for loop** to create five rounds of the game.
* Stored user and computer scores in a variable to declare the winner of the five rounds. 
* Used **template literals** to create a final tally of points.
